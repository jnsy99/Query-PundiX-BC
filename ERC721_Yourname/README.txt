Since Ethereum moved from POW to POS, the Ropsten Testnet and Rinkeby Testnet is down.
I have since created the ERC721 token "YOURNAME" on the Goerli Test Network which includes:
	1. Mint function with Auto Increment ID
	2. Burn Function
	3. Pause function

Please use the Goerli Test Network in the Metamask Wallet instead and add the 
contract address: 0xf960E25876edE27E1516165D183b5A7004D51aFE
